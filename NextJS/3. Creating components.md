If using snippets you can type `rfce` to generate the following **React functional component** boilerplace code:

```jsx
function Header() {
	return (
		<div>
			header
		</div>
	)
}

export default Header
```

After creating the header, be sure to import it in the file it is being used in. For example:

```jsx
import Header from "../components/Header";
```
