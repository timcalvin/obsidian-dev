NEXT.JS is a [[1. Road to React|React]] framework created by Cercel and can be found at [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/).

To setup a next.js project type the following command in terminal:

```
npx create-next-app project-name
```

This will setup the project as well as initialize a git repository.

Next, in the root folder of the project remove `package-lock.json`.

Then, to use **Yarn** instead of **NPM** use the `yarn` command from inside the root folder of your project.

Finally, locate the file `./pages/index.js` and replace it's contents with the following cleaned up starter template:

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div>
			<Head>
				<title>Create Next App</title>
				<meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
				<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
			</Head>

			<h1>Template</h1>

	</div>
	);
}
```

Additionally, add a `components` folder to the root of the project.
