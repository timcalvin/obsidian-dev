[[https://tailwindcss.com/|Tailwind CSS]] is a responsive CSS framework for building modern web sites.

*Note:* installing tailwind will eliminate all standard formatting tags such as `<h1>`. 

In the root folder of your project use the following commands (note these use Yarn, but you can use `npm install` instad of `yarn add`):

```terminal
// install Tailwind CSS
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

// creat config files
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Once you've completed these steps you will need to exclude the next.js css files from compiling by adding them to the content key of `tailwind.config.js`.

```javascript
content: [ 
	"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", 
	"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", 
	"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
```

Above the `content` key, add a `mode` key with a value of `jit` to use the *just in time* compiler.

```javascript
mode: 'jit',
```

Next, replace the entire `global.css` file which can be found in `./styles/global.css`, with the following lines:

```css
@tailwind base; 
@tailwind components; 
@tailwind utilities;
```

While you're in that folder you can delete `Home.module.css`. You will also need to remove the following line from `./pages/index.js`:

```javascript
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
```
