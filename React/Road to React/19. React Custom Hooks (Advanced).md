Previous [[18. React Side-Effects]] | Next [[20. React Fragments]]

Two of the most popular React hooks are [[13. React State|useState]] and [[18. React Side-Effects|useEffect]], with useState being used for values that change over time, and useEffect being used to opt into the lifecycle of your components to introduce side-effects. Let's create a custom Hook ourselves.

```jsx
const useStorageState = (key, initialState) => {

	const [value, setValue] = React.useState(
		localStorage.getItem(key) || initialState
	);

	React.useEffect(() => {
		localStorage.setItem(key, value);
	}, [value, key]);
	
	return [value, setValue];
};
```
