Previous [[9. React DOM]] | Next [[11. Handler function in JSX]]

So far we have declared [[4. React Components|components]] using standard function declaration, however you can use arrow functions.

```jsx
// function declaration
function App() { . . . }

// arrow function expression
const App = () => { . . . }
```

If an arrow functionâ€™s only purpose is to return a value and it doesnâ€™t have any business logic in between, you can remove the **block body** (curly braces) of the function. In a **concise body**, an **implicit return statement** is attached, so you can remove the return statement:

```jsx
// with block body
const addOne = (count) => {
	// perform any task in between
	return count + 1
};

// with concise body as multi-line
const addOne = (count) =>
	count + 1;

// with concise body as one line
const addOne = (count) => count + 1;
```
