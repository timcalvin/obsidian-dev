Props allow us to pass variables as information from one component to another. Here is how this works. Say you established a list of stories inside the app component.

```jsx
const stories = [
	{
		title: 'React',
		url: 'https://reactjs.org/',
		author: 'Jordan Walke',
		num_comments: 3,
		points: 4,
		objectID: 0,
	},
	{
		title: 'Redux',
		url: 'https://redux.js.org/',
		author: 'Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark',
		num_comments: 2,
		points: 5,
		objectID: 1,
	},
];
```

Then later on in the App components return, you can pass this data into the List component as a property (or prop for short).

```jsx
<div>
	<List list={stories} />
</div>
```

Finally the List component would receive any properties sent through via the components HTML attribute and would use them like this.

```jsx
const List = (props) => (
	<ul>
		{props.list.map(function (item) {
			return (
				<li key={item.objectID}>
					<span>
						<a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
					</span>
					<span>{item.author}</span>
					<span>{item.num_comments}</span>
					<span>{item.points}</span>
				</li>
			);
		})}
	</ul>
)
```

Data passed through props is immutable. Data passed using props can only go from the parent to the child, not vice versa.
