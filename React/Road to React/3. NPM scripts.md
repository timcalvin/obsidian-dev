Project specific commands are found in the [[2. Project structure|package.json]] file under the `scripts` property. To execute a script run

```
npm run <script-name>
```

There are default scripts that come as part of the Vite setup. The `dev` script builds the project to run locally, while the `build` script builds the project for production. Finally `preview` executes the server build locally for testing, but you must run the `build` script before running the `preview` script.

To exit a running build press `Control + C`.
