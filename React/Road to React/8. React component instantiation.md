A quick recap of object-oriented programming in JavaScript

```javascript
class Person {
	constructor(firstName, lastName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
		this.lastName = lastName;
	}
	
	getName() {
		returnthis.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
	}
}

const tim = new Person('Tim', 'Bryant');

console.log(tim.getName());
// "Tim Bryant"
```

A class has a constructor that takes arguments and assigns them to the class instance when instantiating it. It can also define functions (methods).

React [[4. React Components|components]] work in much the same way with a single declaration, which can have multiple instances.

```jsx
function Name() {
	return (
		<div>
			// JSX to create component
		</div>
	);
}
```
