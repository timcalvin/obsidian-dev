This is a lightweight starter component

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello React</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

It may also be a good idea to clear out `src/App.css` and `src/index.css` to have a clean slate to start with.

- Components are defined in _PascalCase_ meaning they have to start with a capital letter, otherwise they won't be treated as components.
- You can pass data between components using props in the form of parameters in the component's signature.
- Components return [[5. React JSX|JSX]] which looks similar to HTML.

Function components can also implement details between the function signature and the return statement.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
	// you can do something here

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello React</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

The function of a component runs every time a component is displayed. Given this any variable inside the function will be redefined each time the function runs.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';

function App() {
	const title = 'react';

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello React</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

If you don't want or need the variable to be defined every time the function runs, you can move it outside.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
	const title = 'react';

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello React</h1>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

As a general rule, if a variable does not need anything from within the function component's body, then define it outside.
