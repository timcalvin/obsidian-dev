Previous [[21. Reusable React Component]] | Next [[23. Imperative React]]

Previously all React tags have been self closing, but they don't have to be. Instead of we can do something like this.

```jsx
<InputWithLabel id="search" value={searchTerm} onInputChange={handleSearch} >
	Search:
</InputWithLabel>
```

And the [[4. React Components|component]] will use children props instead of props to use the information between the opening and closing tags.

```jsx
const InputWith Label = ({
	id,
	value,
	type = 'text',
	onInputChange,
	children,
}) => (
	<>
		<lable htmlFor={id}>{children}</label>
		&nbsp;
		<input
			id={id}
			type={type}
			value={value}
			onChange={onInputChange}
		/>
	</>
);
```
