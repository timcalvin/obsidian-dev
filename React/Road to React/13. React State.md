The useeState function is called a React hook.

State gives React a mutable data structure. State can be passed to children with [[12. React Props|props]] but can also get mutated by using a function to modify the state. When a state gets mutated, the [[4. React Components|component]] containing the state and all of its children will be re-rendered.

To create state, you'll need to use the `useState` method.

```jsx
const Search = () => {
	const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');

	const handleChange = (event) => {
		setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
	}

	...
}
```

React's `useState` method takes an *initial state* as an argument. In the case above that is just an empty string.

Calling `useState` will return two values. the first (`searchTerm`) represents the *current state*. The second entry (`setSearchTerm`) is a function to update this state.
