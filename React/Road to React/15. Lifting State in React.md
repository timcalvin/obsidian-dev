Previous [[14. Callback Handlers in JSX]] | Next [[16. React Controlled Components]]

Instead of passing the [[13. React State|state]] up using a [[14. Callback Handlers in JSX|callback handler]], you could instantiate the state in the parent [[4. React Components|component]].

```jsx
const App = () => {
	const stories = [ . . . ];
	
	const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');

	const handleSearch = (event) => {
		setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>My Hacker Stories</h1>
			
			<Search onSearch={handleSearch} />
		
			<hr />

			<List list={stories} />
		</div>
	);
};

const Search = (props) => {

	<div>
		<label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
		<input id="search" type="text" onChange={props.onSearch} />
	</div>

};
```

Now the Search component doesn't manage state anymore, the App component does. Search only passes the event up to the App component. The process of moving state from one component to another is known as *lifting state*.

As a rule of thumb, always manage state at a component level where every component that is interested in it is either directly managing it, or can receive it via props. If a component below needs to update the state, pass a callback handler down to it which allows it to update the state above in the parent. If the component below needs to use the state (displaying it for example), pass it down as props.
