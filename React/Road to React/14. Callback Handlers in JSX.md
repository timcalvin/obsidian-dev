Previous [[13. React State]] | Next [[15. Lifting State in React]]

While [[12. React Props|props]] are used to pass information from parent to child [[4. React Components|components]], [[13. React State|state]] can be used to change information over time. However props only allow one way communication from parent to descendant components, and while state can make information stateful, it too can only be passed down by using props as a container.

At times we may need to pass information to a parent component. For example, passing the state of a search component to the App component so it can filter an array before it is displayed. This is what a callback handler is used for. It works by:

1. Being introduced as an event handler
2. Gets passed as a function in props to another component
3. Is executed there as a callback handler
4. Calls back to the place it was introduced

```jsx
const App = () => {
	const stories = [ . . . ];

	// 1. intrduced
	const handleSearch = (event) => {
		// 4. calls back
		console.log(event.target.value);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>My Hacker Stories</h1>
			// { 2. passed down }
			<Search onSearch={handleSearch} />
		
			<hr />

			<List list={stories} />
		</div>
	);
};

const Search = (props) => {
	const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');

	const handleChange = (event) => {
		setSearchTerm(event.target.value);

		// 3. executed as callback
	};
	
	return ( . . . );
};
```
