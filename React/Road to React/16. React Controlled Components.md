Previous [[15. Lifting State in React]] | Next [[17. Props Handling (Advanced)]]

HTML elements come with their internal [[13. React State|state]] which is not coupled to React.

If you set an initial state for an HTML element, the element itself needs to be informed of the React state, by providing the current state as `value` to it.

```jsx
const App = () => {
	. . . 
	
	const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('React');

	. . . 

	<Search search={searchTerm} onSearch={handleSearch} />
};

const Search = (props) => {
	. . .

	<input 
		id="search" 
		type="text" 
		value={props.search} 
		onChange={props.onSearch} 
	/>
		
	. . .
};
```
