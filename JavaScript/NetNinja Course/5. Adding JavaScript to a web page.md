JavaScript can be added to a web page anywhere between the `head` tags or anywhere between the `body` tags. The majority of the time the best place to place it is directly before the `</body>` tag.

```html
<script>
	alert('hello, world');
</script>
```

A better practice is to place the code in a separate `.js` file and import it into your page.

```html
<script src="filename.js" />
```
